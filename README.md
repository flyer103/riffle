## Quick Start

1. Edit the configuration files to match your interests:
   - Add your RSS feeds to `feeds.opml` (see example in `conf/feeds.opml`)
   - Add your interests to `interests.txt` (see example in `conf/interests.txt`)

2. Run Riffle:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   riffle -o feeds.opml -i interests.txt
   ```

## Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
riffle -o <opml-file> [-i <interests-file>] [-n <article-count>] [-t <top-count>] [-m <model-name>]
```

### Command Line Options

| Flag | Short | Description | Default |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--opml` | `-o` | Path to OPML file (required) | - |
| `--interests` | `-i` | Path to file containing interests (one per line) | - |
| `--articles` | `-n` | Number of articles to fetch from each feed (from last 2 days) | 3 |

### Output Format

The tool provides output in four main sections:

1. **Recent Articles** (ðŸ“°)
   - Lists all articles from the last 2 days, grouped by RSS source
   - Shows title, URL, publication date, and summary (if available)
   - Only includes articles from your current time zone's last 48 hours

2. **Inactive Sources** (ðŸ“…)
   - Lists RSS sources with no updates in the last 2 days
   - Helps track which feeds are currently inactive

3. **Most Valuable Articles** (ðŸŒŸ)
   - Unified recommendations across all sources
   - Shows detailed scoring and reasoning for each recommendation:
     * Interest Match Score (0.00-1.00)
     * Content Quality Score (0.00-1.00)
     * Overall Score (0.00-1.00)
     * Explanation of why the article was recommended

4. **AI Analysis** (ðŸ“Š)
   - Provides in-depth analysis of recommended articles using Perplexity AI

### Examples

1. Basic usage with default settings:
   ```bash
   riffle -o feeds.opml
   ```
   This will:
   - Process articles from the last 2 days
   - Fetch up to 3 articles per feed
   - Show 1 most valuable article recommendation
   - Use default AI model for analysis

2. Include personal interests for better recommendations:
   ```bash
   riffle -o feeds.opml -i interests.txt
   ```
   This will:
   - Match articles against your interests
   - Improve recommendation quality
   - Show interest match scores
   - Include AI analysis of top articles

3. Get more recommendations with custom model:
   ```bash
   riffle -o feeds.opml -i interests.txt -t 3 -m "custom-model"
   ```
   This will:
   - Show the top 3 most valuable articles
   - Rank them by overall score
   - Include detailed reasoning for each
   - Use specified AI model for analysis

4. Fetch more articles per feed:
   ```bash
   riffle -o feeds.opml -i interests.txt -n 5
   ```
   This will:
   - Fetch up to 5 articles per feed (from last 2 days)
   - Process more content for better selection
   - Still respect the 2-day time window
   - Include AI analysis of recommendations

Note: Articles are always filtered to the last 2 days in your current time zone, regardless of how many articles you request with `-n`. This ensures you only see recent, relevant content.

### Configuration Files

#### OPML File Format (feeds.opml)
The OPML file contains your RSS feed subscriptions, organized by category. Example structure:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<opml version="1.0">
    <head>
        <title>Tech Feed Subscriptions</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <outline text="Programming">
            <outline type="rss" 
                    text="The Go Blog" 
                    xmlUrl="https://go.dev/blog/feed.atom"/>
        </outline>
    </body>
</opml>
```

See `conf/feeds.opml` for a complete example with multiple feeds and categories.

#### Interests File Format (interests.txt)
The interests file contains your topics of interest, one per line. You can:
- Group interests with comments (lines starting with #)
- Use multiple words per interest
- Order by priority (all interests are weighted equally)

Example structure:
```
# Programming Languages
golang programming
rust development

# Technologies
cloud native
distributed systems
```

See `conf/interests.txt` for a complete example with various technology interests.

### Scoring System

Articles are scored based on multiple factors with equal weighting:

1. Content Quality (50%):
   - Text length (40% of quality score)
   - Keyword relevance (40% of quality score)
   - Link quality (20% of quality score)

2. Interest Match (50%):
   - Relevance to your specified interests
   - Matches are calculated using word-based analysis
   - Multiple word interests are handled intelligently

The final score is a combination of both factors, helping you find articles that are both high-quality and relevant to your interests.
