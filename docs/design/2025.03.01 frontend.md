I want to add a front-end display for `riffle`, which will interact with riffle server through API and provide visual RSS reading service.

On the functional level, the following operations are implemented:
- A modern web operation interface
- All RSS sources are displayed on the left side of the page, and the 10 most recent articles of each RSS source are displayed on the right side of the page. By default, 3 articles are recommended
- When you click on the RSS source on the left side of the page, the 10 most recent articles of the RSS source will be displayed on the right side of the page
- Call the API every 10 minutes to refresh and obtain the latest content of each RSS source

In terms of technology stack, requirements:
- Use `vuejs` as the front-end framework
- Use `Material 3` as the design style
- Put the front-end code in the `frontend/` directory
